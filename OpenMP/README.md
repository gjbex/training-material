# OpenMP

Some sample code illustrating OpenMP concepts and techniques.

## What is it?
1. `Allocation`: illustration of how to do memory allocation and
    initialization taking into account data locality in the context of
    OpenMP.
1. `FortranBlock`: using a Fortran block construct in an OpenMP block (don't!!!)
1. `Iterators`: illustrates how to use an OpenMP `for` with C++ random
    access iterators, and the `linear` clause on that directive.
`. `MultiLevel`: illustration of nested OpenMP in the context of Intel's
   MKL library (SVD).
1. `ReentrantFunctions`: illustration of reentrant versus non-reentrant
   functions.
1. `Tasks`: some examples of using OpenMP tasks
