# Armadillo
Some sample code for using the Armadillo linear algebra library.

## What is it?
1. `matrix_product.cpp`: matrix-matrix multiplication example, and
    random initialization of their elements.
1. `read_matrix.cpp`: illustrates reading a matrix from a text file, and
    compute its determinant.
1. `matrix_vector_product.cpp`: illustrates matrix-vector product.
1. `svd.cpp`: illustration of computing an SVD, and reconstructing
    the original matrix, comparing with the original matrix.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the sample code.
