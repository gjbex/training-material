# STL
Some sample code for using the STL library.

## What is it?
1. `list_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL lists.
1. `map_functions.cpp`: using a template function to work with `map` as
    well as `unordered_map`.
1. `map_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL maps, and `auto`
    type.
1. `priority_queue.cpp`: implements an example of using a priority queue
    for non-trivial items.
1. `set_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL sets.
1. `vector_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL vectors with
    iterators.
1. `valarray_stl.cpp`: very basic illustration of using STL valarrays with
    iterators.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the sample code.
