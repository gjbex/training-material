# Eigen

Eigen is a header-only library for linear algrebra in C++.

## What is it?

1. `matrix_product.cpp`: illustration of a matrix product using Eigen.
1. `read_matrix.cpp`: read matrix eleemnts from a text file to initialize an Eigen matrix.
1. `solve_eqns.cpp`: solve a set of two linear equantions using LU decomposition.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.
1. `Mkl`: illustration how to use Intel's MKL to perform Eigen's
    computations under the hood.
