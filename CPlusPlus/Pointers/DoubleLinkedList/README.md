# DoubleLinkedList

Implementation of a double linked list that takes only 2*N* space.   This illustrates
that raw pointers are sometimes required when designing container. It also
illustrates the implementation of an iterator so that the container can
be used in a range-for loop.

## What is it?

1. `src`: source directory
   1. `double_linked_list.h`: definition and implementation of the container.
   1. `main.cpp`: application to illustrate the use of the container.
   1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the application.
1. `CMakeLists.txt`: CMake file to build the application.
