1. `circle.cc`: circle class definition.
1. `circle_factory.h`: class declaration of a circle factory.
1. `circle_factory.cc`: class definition of a circle factory.
1. `random_circles.cc`: generate random circles using the factory class.
1. `circle_overlap.cc`: check how many circles have overlap, read from
    output generated by `random_circles.cc`.
1. `random_circles.cc`: generate random circles within [0, 1] x [0, 1]
    with given radius, and write to standard output.
1. `show_circles.py`: Python script to visualize random circles.
1. `./generate_overlap_data.sh`: Bash script to generate the fraction of
    circles that overlap another as a function of the number of circles.
1. `plot_overlap_data.plt`: gnuplot script to plot the overlap data to the
    screen.
1. `Makefile`: make file to build the applications.

## How to use?
Use `make` to generate the overlap plot, i.e.,
