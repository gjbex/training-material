# `tree_2k`
This is a library that implements a tree data structure to store and
query spatial data.

It is similar to a quadtree, but works for any specified rank.

## What is it?
1. `src`: contains the source code of the implementation of the data
    structures and algorithms.
1. `src/test`: unit tests written for the `CUnit` framework.

## Requirements
* A C89 compliant compiler, and GNU make to build.
* To compile and run the tests, CUnit is required.
* To generate HTML and LaTeX documentation, doxygen is required.
