# C
This is some sample code written in C, with no or little bearing on
libraries.  It is mainly intended to illustrate some programming concepts
and idiosyncracies particular to C.

## What is it?
1. `C99`: illustration of some C99 features.
1. `Misc`: some illustration of miscellaneous C features.
1. `Tree_2K`: library for storing spatial data in a tree-like data
    structure that allows range queries.  It illustrates some pointer
    juggling, bit-level operations, error handling, CUnit testing, C99
    features, and Doxygen documentation.
1. `c_intro.pptx`: Powerpoint presentation based on Kernighan and
    Ritchie's "The C programming language".
1. `Stdarg`: example of functions with variadic arguments using `stdarg.h`.
