# Debugging
Some sample code to illustrate the use of debugging tools.  Also some unit
testing code is shown, since trying to prevent bugs is better than fixing
them.

## What is it?
1. `Arithmetic`: illustrations of arithmetic bugs.
1. `ControlFlow`: illustrations of bugs in the control flow.
1. `MemoryIssues`: sample code to illustrate various memory issues.
1. `CodeCoverage`: illustration of how to use code coverage tools.
1. `CompilerFlags`: illustration of the value of specifying maximal warnings
    when compiling, as well as trying multiple compilers.
1. `CppAlgorithms`: illustration of C++ specific bugs.
1. `CUnit`: very simple illustration of how to use the CUnit testing
    framework for testing C code.
1. `debugging.pptx`: Microsoft Powerpoint presentation on defensive
