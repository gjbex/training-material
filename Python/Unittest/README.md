# Unittest
Testing is an integral part of the software development process.  Unit
testing is a popular technique, and is used in test-driven development
(TDD).  Python's `unittest` module in its standard library is quite
versatile.

## What is it?
1. `Simple`: a simple example demonstrating useful assertion function in
    unittest`.
1. `Fixtures`: an example of the use of fixtures for unit testing in the
    context of database testing.
1. `Asserts`: `assert` is a Python statement, so it not part of unit
    testing per se.  It is mainly intended for contract-based programming
    and one can prevent code to be emitted for asserts by using the
    `-O` optimizatino flag when running the code.
