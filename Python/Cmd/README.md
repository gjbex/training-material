# Cmd
Standard Python library framework to facilitate writing command line
driven interpreters.

## What is it?
1. `simple.py`: a very simmple example that keeps track of a list of
    friends.  A friend is added by saying `hi` to her, and is removed by
    saying `bye` to her.  You can't say `hi` to someone who is your friend
    already, and you can't say `bye` to someone who isn't your friend.
    `show_friends` lists the current friends.  `quit` exits the
    application.  Note that `help` and tab completion are automatically
    provided.
