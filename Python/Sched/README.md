# Sched
Sometimes it can be useful to run functions at certain moments in time,
similar to what cron does on Linux operatring systems.

## What is it?
* `cron.py`: example script using `schedule` that runs two tasks, one
    printing the time, and a computed value, the other updating the
    value to be printed.  The first is scheduled every 2 seconds, the
    other every second.
